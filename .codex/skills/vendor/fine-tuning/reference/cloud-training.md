# Cloud Training Reference

Cloud training uses the existing SFT and KTO trainers plus the env-backed GRPO path, but persistence and code sync behave differently from local runs.

---

## Exact Source Requirements

Cloud jobs run from the exact git revision you launch:
- tracked worktree must be clean
- current branch must be named
- `HEAD` must already be pushed to `origin/<branch>`

If any of those checks fail, the cloud backend stops before submitting a job.

---

## Provider-Native Storage

Cloud artifacts are durable by default in the provider ecosystem:

| Provider | Default Artifact Backend | Durable Location |
|----------|--------------------------|------------------|
| `hf_jobs` | `hf_bucket` | Hugging Face Bucket |
| `modal` | `modal_volume` | Modal Volume |
| `runpod` | `runpod_network_volume` | RunPod Network Volume |

Remote container filesystems are not treated as durable storage.

---

## Canonical Cloud Run Layout

Every cloud run writes the same logical tree:

```text
runs/{provider}/{method}/{timestamp}-{shortsha}/
├── checkpoints/
├── logs/
├── final_model/
├── training_lineage.json
└── manifest.json
```

`manifest.json` is the quickest way to confirm the artifact backend, commit, and publish settings for a run.

---

## Optional Final-Model Publish

Publishing to Hugging Face Hub is optional and disabled by default.

When enabled:
- only `final_model/` is uploaded
- checkpoints, logs, manifests, and lineage stay in provider-native storage
- the publish target is a Hugging Face model repo

---

## Smoke-Test Workflow

1. Confirm the branch is clean and pushed.
2. Point the trainer config at a remote dataset when possible.
3. Run `python tuner.py cloud`.
4. Choose provider and method.
5. Start with a short smoke test (`max_steps`, small dataset slice, or one epoch).
6. Verify artifacts in provider-native storage before enabling final-model publish.

Recommended first-pass checks:
- `hf_jobs`: inspect the configured bucket prefix under `runs/hf_jobs/...`
- `modal`: inspect the configured Modal Volume path
- `runpod`: inspect the mounted RunPod Network Volume path

For HF Jobs specifically, bucket-backed artifacts are the primary source of truth once they start appearing:
- training: `logs/training_latest.jsonl`, `logs/stage_summary.json`, `training_lineage.json`
- evaluation: `evaluation_results.json`, `evaluation_results.md`, `evaluation_lineage.json`, then `logs/eval_progress.jsonl`
- loss: `loss_lineage.json`, `loss_summary.json`, `per_example_losses.jsonl`, `high_loss_examples.jsonl`

Use the repo CLI for quick bucket reads/lists:
```bash
python tuner.py bucket analyze --path runs/hf_jobs/sft/<run-prefix>/
python tuner.py bucket read --path runs/hf_jobs/sft/<run-prefix>/logs/training_latest.jsonl --jsonl-latest --pretty
python tuner.py bucket list --path runs/hf_jobs/sft/<run-prefix>/ --limit 20
python tuner.py bucket pull --path runs/hf_jobs/sft/<run-prefix>/analysis/loss/ --dest .
python tuner.py bucket push --path local/notes.json --dest runs/manual_uploads/
```

When a training run has multiple eval reruns or alternate loss benchmarks:
```bash
python tuner.py bucket analyze \
  --path runs/hf_jobs/sft/<run-prefix>/ \
  --eval-path runs/hf_jobs/sft/<run-prefix>/evaluations/vllm/<eval-prefix>/ \
  --loss-path runs/hf_jobs/sft/<run-prefix>/analysis/loss/
```

Keep the checked-in benchmark ledger updated from finished runs:
- [model_hardware_benchmark_ledger.md](/path/to/training-project/docs/benchmarks/model_hardware_benchmark_ledger.md)
- [model_hardware_benchmark_ledger.csv](/path/to/training-project/docs/benchmarks/model_hardware_benchmark_ledger.csv)

For `run-experiment`, the analysis bundle now appends or updates the ledger automatically using:
- training lineage
- evaluation summary
- loss results when present
- live HF hourly pricing when available

The ledger is derived. The stage lineage artifacts remain the canonical source of truth for train/eval/loss metadata.

Use raw HF job logs mainly for:
- bootstrap failures before the bucket prefix exists
- dependency/runtime crashes before the first artifact sync
- debugging low-level container issues

## Blind Hardware Planning

Use the planner when you want a back-of-the-envelope stage recommendation without relying on prior run telemetry:

```bash
python tuner.py plan-hardware \
  --experiment-spec Trainers/cloud/experiments/qwen3_4b_full_cycle_full_v2.yaml \
  --optimize-for balanced
```

Current planner inputs:
- model name / parameter scale inferred from the spec
- method (`sft`, `kto`, `grpo`)
- seq length
- 4-bit loading flag
- target batch / effective batch
- live HF Jobs hardware flavors and hourly pricing

Current planner outputs:
- recommended training / evaluation / loss flavor
- recommended training microbatch and gradient accumulation when the spec leaves them unset
- estimated memory footprint and headroom
- relative speed-vs-cost ranking

Use it automatically at launch:

```bash
python tuner.py run-experiment \
  --experiment-spec Trainers/cloud/experiments/qwen3_4b_full_cycle_full_v2.yaml \
  --auto-hardware \
  --optimize-for cost \
  --yes
```

For multi-spec benchmark launches, use the staggered launcher instead of submitting several `run-experiment` commands back-to-back:

```bash
python3 scripts/launch_experiment_batch.py \
  Trainers/cloud/experiments/qwen3_4b_full_cycle_benchmark_l40sx1_pruned.yaml \
  Trainers/cloud/experiments/qwen3_4b_full_cycle_benchmark_a100_large_pruned.yaml \
  --auto-hardware \
  --optimize-for cost \
  --yes
```

Gotcha:
- The launcher defaults to a 5-second stagger. Keep it on unless you have a specific reason to remove it; same-second submissions are harder to monitor and used to collide on timestamp-derived artifact prefixes.
- Do not treat large unused VRAM headroom as a success case on its own. Read `training_lineage.json` and check `capacity_profile`:
  - if peak reserved VRAM is well below half of device memory or headroom is still tens of GB, the run is underpacked
  - for large-memory tiers like `a100-large`, that usually means you left training throughput on the table
  - increase microbatch or otherwise retune before treating the hardware choice as optimized
- On `a100-large` and above, default to aggressive packing:
  - do not reduce batch just because you switched to DoRA, rsLoRA, or another adapter variant
  - start from the highest known-good packed shape for that model family
  - accept that an exploratory OOM is preferable to quietly wasting half the card
  - only back off after a real OOM or reproducible instability signal

---

## HF Jobs Bucket and Auth Gotchas

For `hf_jobs`, a few patterns matter enough to treat as hard rules:

- Never cancel a live HF job, delete bucket data, or relaunch a cloud run unless the user explicitly approves that specific action first.
- Do not infer approval for cancel/delete/relaunch from a request to inspect, check, monitor, compare, or switch focus.
- The job runs from the exact pushed commit. If the remote logs show an older `HEAD`, you launched the wrong SHA and are debugging stale code.
- Keep the main training interpreter compatible with Unsloth and Transformers. If bucket sync needs a newer `huggingface_hub`, install it in an isolated helper path or subprocess, not into the training runtime.
- Pass `HF_TOKEN` into `run_job(...)` explicitly via job secrets. Do not assume the container automatically receives your local token.
- Normalize blank auth values to `None`. An empty `HF_TOKEN` or `HF_API_KEY` can produce `Authorization: Bearer ` and fail before the request is sent.
- Resolve and, if needed, create the bucket once before training starts. During steady-state log sync, use the resolved bucket ID directly.
- Keep HF job labels conservative. Do not put slash-heavy values like raw `bucket_id` or `artifact_prefix` into labels; HF Jobs can reject submission. Recover those values from command args or other metadata instead.
- Polling and identity checks should be conservative. Frequent bucket creation attempts or repeated `whoami-v2` calls can hit Hugging Face rate limits.

If the training process itself is healthy but uploads fail, inspect bucket auth and sync isolation before touching trainer code.

## HF Jobs Cloud Evaluation

You can evaluate a bucketed HF Jobs run on remote GPU without converting to GGUF:

```bash
python tuner.py cloud-eval --run latest --preset full
```

What it does:
- resolves the configured HF bucket and picks the requested run (`latest` works)
- submits a new HF Job on GPU
- downloads the run's `final_model/` LoRA adapter from the bucket
- runs `Evaluator.cli --backend unsloth ...` directly in the HF job using the downloaded adapter
- syncs evaluation outputs back into the same bucket under:
  `runs/hf_jobs/{method}/{run_slug}/evaluations/vllm/{timestamp}/`

Saved files to inspect:
- `evaluation_results.json` - canonical machine-readable summary and all records
- `evaluation_results.md` - human-readable report
- `evaluation_lineage.json` - provenance / model-card material
- `logs/eval_progress.jsonl` - incremental progress events used for the local cloud dashboard

For experiment orchestration:
- `run-experiment` now defaults to **parallel** post-training execution
- evaluation and exact loss submit as separate sibling jobs after training completes
- analysis waits for both selected post-training stages
- use `post_training.mode: same_job` only when you intentionally want the older embedded eval+loss path for a smoke/fallback run

Same-job exact-loss gotcha:
- `cloud-eval --with-loss` and `post_training.mode: same_job` install stage-local helper packages such as `peft` into an overlay path.
- Those packages must be available on the evaluator process `PYTHONPATH`, not just the bucket-sync helper subprocess path.
- If embedded exact loss fails with `peft is required to load LoRA adapter checkpoints for exact loss scoring`, inspect the runtime `PYTHONPATH` wiring before debugging dataset or model artifacts.

Inspection workflow:
1. Find the source training run under `runs/hf_jobs/{method}/{run_slug}/`
2. Open the newest directory under `evaluations/vllm/`
3. Read `evaluation_results.json` first
4. Use `evaluation_results.md` when you want a concise human summary
5. Use `evaluation_lineage.json` if the question is about reproducibility or upload metadata
6. Use `logs/eval_progress.jsonl` only when debugging in-flight or partially failed runs
7. For local inspection from the CLI, use:

```bash
python tuner.py cloud-inspect --run latest --eval-run latest --method sft
```

Interpreting saved failures:
- Do not jump from a failed case count straight to a training conclusion.
- First separate infrastructure or evaluator noise from actual model behavior failures.
- Prefer the structured record fields over raw response text when both are available.
- Classify failures by mechanism:
  wrong action selected relative to the scenario
  response type mismatch
  malformed structured output or parse failure
  missing required fields
  behavior-expectation mismatch
- The useful question is: what did the model do instead of what the evaluation expected?
- Keep this analysis generic. The same method should work across different prompt formats, toolsets, and custom evaluation configs.

Useful flags:
- `--method sft` or `--method kto` to filter run discovery
- `--scenario behavior_prompts.yaml` to run specific scenarios instead of a preset
- `--tags storageManager,intellectual_humility` to filter cases
- `--upload-to-hf username/model-name --update-model-card` to push evaluation lineage to a model repo

Current constraint:
- the LoRA adapter's `base_model_name_or_path` must point to a hub-accessible model, not a local filesystem path

Anti-patterns:
- Do not assume the Unsloth training image is also a stable vLLM-serving runtime. vLLM, Transformers, tokenizers, Triton, and CUDA can drift independently.
- Do not assume multi-GPU HF flavors automatically give you tensor-parallel vLLM. Prequantized BitsAndBytes base models (for example `*-bnb-4bit`) cannot use vLLM tensor parallelism in this path, so multi-GPU eval may need to fall back to single-GPU generation while exact loss still uses all visible GPUs afterward.
- Do not install a newer `huggingface_hub` into the main Unsloth eval interpreter just to satisfy bucket sync. Keep bucket sync in the helper subprocess path.
- Do not trust preset names blindly. The `eval_run.yaml` preset filenames must match the actual files under `Evaluator/config/scenarios/`.

If you want one command for the common path, use:

```bash
python tuner.py cloud-pipeline --method sft --preset full
```

That trains on HF Jobs first, then launches cloud evaluation against the exact finished run. It is the preferred UX for train-followed-by-eval.

## Recovery and Cleanup

- Resume-from-provider-native-storage is not automatic yet.
- Persistence is guaranteed first; resume flows can be added later.
- Clean up old runs from the provider-native backend explicitly when they are no longer needed.
